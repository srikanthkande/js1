GULP :: gulp gives you fast builds 

BOWER :: Keeping track of all these packages and making sure they are up to date (or set to the specific versions you need) 
is tricky. Bower to the rescue! 
    Bower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesn’t concatenate or
minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies.

Grunt :: task runner
    In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, 
    unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it through a Gruntfile, a task runner 
    can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort.
